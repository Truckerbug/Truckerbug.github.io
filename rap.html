    <title>Epic Rap</title>

<body>
    Yeah, yeah
Ayo, dudes, it's time.
It's time, dudes (aight, dudes, begin).
Straight out the epic dungeons of rap.

The hen drops deep as does my fox.
I never sleep, 'cause to sleep is the brother of clocks.
Beyond the walls of controllers, life is defined.
I think of Github when I'm in for some fine time.

Hope the frame got some aim.
My shame don't like no dirty name.
Run up to the claim and get the lame (Yeah).


What more could you ask for? The fun hen?
You complain about the crud shack.
I gotta love it though - somebody still speaks for the den.

I'm rappin' to the computer,
And I'm gonna move your pewter.

Cool, amazing, defined, like a game.
Boy, I tell you, I thought you had fame.

I can't take the crud shack, can't take the pc.
I woulda tried to walk I guess I got no DLC.

I'm rappin' to the pewter,
And I'm gonna move your computer.

When I was young my brother had a shooter.
Ain't a soul alive that could take my brother's pewter.

A cool github page is quite the sight.

Thinking of github (yeah) thinking of GitHub.
